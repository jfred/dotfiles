  if you want to detect filetype from filename...

    let g:gist_detect_filetype = 1

  if you want to open browser after the post...

    let g:gist_open_browser_after_post = 1

  if you want to change the browser...

    let g:gist_browser_command = 'w3m %URL%'

  or

    let g:gist_browser_command = 'opera %URL% &'
